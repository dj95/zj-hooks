## üöÄ Usage

When zj-hooks is installed, simply add it with its configuration to the layout you like.

Hooks in the configuration must be named alphanumeric. Configuration of a hook consists of the following parts:

- **hook_NAME_event** The type of event that should trigger the hook. Please refer to current supported events.
- **hook_NAME_command** The command that should be run on the event type. It can contain placeholders, that are replaced by certain event details.

```javascript
plugin location="file:path/to/zj-hooks.wasm" {
    hook_test_event     "session"
    hook_test_command   "bash -c 'echo {{session_name}} >> test.log'"
}
```

### Supported Events

| Event Type | Supported placeholders |
|------------|------------------------|
| `session`  | `{{session_name}}` |
| `tab` | `{{active_tab_position}}` `{{active_tab_name}}` |
| `pane` | |
| `mode` | `{{mode}}` |

## üì¶ Installation

Download the latest binary in the GitHub releases. Place it somewhere, zellij is able to access it. Then the
plugin can be included by referencing it either via [plugin aliases](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-aliases) or directly in a layout file.

You could also refer to the plugin guide from zellij, after downloading the binary: [https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-loading](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-loading)

```javascript
plugins {
  zj-hooks location="file:/abolute/path/to/zj-hooks.wasm"
}
```

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Installation with nix flake

Add this repository to your inputs and then with the following overlay to your packages.
Then you are able to install and refer to it with `pkgs.zj-hooks`. When templating the
config file, you can use `${pkgs.zj-hooks}/bin/zj-hooks.wasm` as the path.

```nix
inputs = {
# ...

zj-hooks = {
  url = "github:dj95/zj-hooks";
};
};


# define the outputs of this flake - especially the home configurations
outputs = { self, nixpkgs, zj-hooks, ... }@inputs:
let
inherit (inputs.nixpkgs.lib) attrValues;

overlays = with inputs; [
  # ...
  (final: prev: {
    zj-hooks = zj-hooks.packages.${prev.system}.default;
  })
];
```
